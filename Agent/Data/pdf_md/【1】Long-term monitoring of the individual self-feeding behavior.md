Abstract Self-feeding device is extensively used in aquaculture farms, but for salmonids the individual
feeding behavior has seldom been continuously observed. In this article, the individual self-feeding behavior
of 10 rainbow trout was continuously monitored with a PIT tag record for 50 days with three replicates. The
fi sh fell into three categories according to their feeding behavior, i.e. high triggering fi sh (trigger behavior
more than 25% of the group, HT), low triggering fi sh (1%–25%, LT) and zero triggering fi sh (less than
1%). The results showed that in a group of 10 individual 1–2 HT fi sh accounted for most of the self-feeding
behavior (78.19%–89.14%), which was far more than they could consume. The trigger frequency of the
fi sh was signifi cantly correlated with the initial body weight (P <0.01), however, no signifi cant diff erence in
growth rate among the HT, LT, and ZT fi sh was observed ( P >0.05). Cosinor analysis showed that the two
HT fi sh in the same group had similar acrophase. Though some of the HT fi sh could be active for 50 d, there
were also HT fi sh decreased triggering behavior around 40 d and the high trigger status was then replaced by
other fi sh, which was fi rst discovered in salimonds. Interestingly, the growth of the group was not aff ected
by the alternation triggering fi sh. These results provide evidence that in the self-feeding system the HT fi sh
didn’t gain much advantage by their frequent self-feeding behavior, and high trigger status of the HT fi sh is
not only an individual character but also driven by the demand of the group. In the self-feeding system, the
critical individual should be closely monitored.
