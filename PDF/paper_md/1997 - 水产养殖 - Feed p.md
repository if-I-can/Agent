## Abstract

Semi-intensive aquaculture, particularly in the tropics, accounts for nearly 70% of the finfish production of the world. The bulk of this production is based on a handful of species, the most important being the cyprinid species, such as Chinese and Indian major carps, feeding low in the food chain. In the culture practices the endogenous food supply is known to play a major role, and equally the exogenous food supply is very diverse; the latter often ranging from simple mixes of ingredients to pelleted feeds of various forms.

The paper reviews the different feeding strategies currently employed within semi-intensive farming systems for warm-water fish species, including on-farm preparation techniques and management practices. Particular emphasis is placed on the important role played by natural food organisms in the overall nutritional budget of pond-raised fish and the need to reduce food and feeding costs through the use of improved pond fertilization, feed formulation, feed preparation, and on-farm feed and water management techniques. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

## 1. Introduction

According to the latest aquaculture production statistics (FAO, 1993) the total world production of farmed finfish in 1991 was 8 741 283 t (Table 1) or 52.7% of total world aquaculture production and was valued at approximately 16 thousand million US$.

1 and 2). Of the total finfish production, over 80% was realised within semi-intensive or extensive pond-based farming systems. (For the purpose of this paper aquaculture production systems are categorized according to dietary nutrient input (Edwards, 1993; Tacon, 1993) as follows: *Extensive farming systems*—no external nutrient input, whereby fish growth is totally dependent upon the natural productivity of the water body and the consequent endogenous supply of naturally available live food organisms; *Semi-intensive farming systems*—external fertilizer and/or supplementary diet nutrient input, whereby fish growth is dependent upon the consumption of endogenously supplied live food organisms (the production of which is augmented through the application of fertilizers) and externally supplied feeds as a supplementary source of dietary nutrients; and *Intensive farming systems*— external complete diet nutrient input, whereby fish growth is entirely dependent upon the external provision of a nutritionally complete high quality diet.)

Warm-water omnivorous/herbivorous fish species currently dominate finfish production (Fig. 2), with the freshwater cyprinids constituting 70.1% of the total production (Fig. 3) and occupying the top four positions of the fish and crustacean aquaculture production table (Figs. 4 and 5). By contrast, carnivorous fish species represent only 13.2% of total finfish production (ie. 1 152 547 t in 1991); carnivorous fish species constituting 93.4%, 63.8% and 1.5% of the total production of farmed marine fish, diadromous fish and freshwater fish in 1991, respectively.

Despite the fact that warm-water omnivorous/herbivorous fish species constitute over 85% of world aquaculture finfish production, considerably less is known about their culture and dietary nutritional requirements than for carnivorous fish species. For

example, although the total aquaculture production of cyprinids was ten times higher than that of salmonids in 1991 a literature search of the international database ‘Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts’ (ASFA) will show that there is up to twice as much published research information on aquaculture and nutrition for salmonids than cyprinids (Table 2). To a large extent this has been due to the fact that the majority of carnivorous finfish production and aquaculture/nutrition research is realised within ‘‘developed’’ countries whereas the majority of warm-water omnivorous/herbivorous finfish production and research is realised within ‘‘developing’’ countries. Clearly, despite our apparent lack of scientific understanding of warm-water semi-intensive farming systems, the art of semi-intensive fish culture has obviously paid off by virtue its current existence and viability for over two thousand years.

However, in the light of increasing demands on primary resources, such as land and water, the need for maintenance of environmental integrity, and, most of all, the increasing cost of production throughout the world, there is an urgent need to improve our scientific understanding of sustainable semi-intensive farming systems, and, in particular, our knowledge concerning the nutrition and feeding of omnivorous/herbivorous finfish within such systems. Unlike the nutritional studies conducted on carnivorous fish species within intensive culture systems, where the dietary nutrient requirements of the species are entirely met through the exogenous supply of a nutritionally “complete” compounded diet, within semi-intensive pond-based farming systems the dietary nutrient requirements of the cultured species is largely met through the consumption of natural food organisms produced endogenously within the pond and/or through the direct consumption of exogenously supplied “supplementary” feed inputs. Consequently, in addition to the need for conducting basic research studies on the dietary nutrient requirements of warm-water omnivorous/herbivorous fish species in situ under semi-intensive pond conditions, there is also an urgent need to comprehend the dynamics of the pond ecosystem and “integrated” farming system as a whole so as to further improve the nutritional efficiency and benefit of the farming system with the minimum of external feed inputs. The difficulties of conducting and applying nutrient requirement studies under practical semi-intensive pond-based farming conditions has recently been reviewed in another paper (Tacon, 1995).

In this paper, an attempt is made to bring to focus the intricacy in the nutrition of warm-water finfish within semi-intensive farming systems and the areas of research needs. The paper also attempts to review the role and nature of supplementary feeds used within semi-intensive culture practices, as well as the current methods of on-farm feed preparation and feed management.

### 2. Semi-intensive fish farming systems: basic concepts

It is important to emphasize at the outset that semi-intensive farming systems (SIFS) differ from intensive farming systems (IFS) in many fundamental and important respects. For example, apart from the differences between SIFS and IFS in the method employed for supplying the dietary nutrient requirements of the fish species (i.e. fertilization/supplementary diet feeding versus complete diet feeding with compound aquafeeds), fish stocking densities and attainable fish yields within SIFS are considerably less than IFS; fish yields at the lower fish stocking densities employed within SIFS ranging from 0.5 to 20t ha⁻¹ per year as compared to fish yields as high as 1000t ha⁻¹ per year at high fish stocking densities within IFS (Edwards, 1993). In addition, whereas IFS are usually restricted to the culture of high-value carnivorous fish species produced in monoculture within clear running-water tank-based or open-water cage-based farming systems for specialised markets (i.e. usually for export) the production of the generally lower-value (from an international marketing viewpoint) warm-water omnivorous/herbivorous fish species is usually realised as a polyculture of different complementary fish species (i.e. complementary in terms of dietary feeding habits) within static-water pond-based farming-systems and produced mainly for local consump-

Furthermore, in view of the lower market value of most warm-water omnivorous/herbivorous fish species resource-poor SIFS farmers are usually restricted to the use of traditional fertilizer and/or low-cost on-farm prepared supplementary feed inputs; the farming activity usually being small-scale in nature and generally “integrated” with the production of agricultural crops and/or livestock as a secondary activity within an “integrated agriculture-aquaculture farming system” (for reviews see also Edwards (1991), Chong (1993), De Silva (199

As indicated earlier the role played by supplementary feed(s) within SIFS is not straightforward as there are complex interactions between natural food organisms (also referred to as the endogenous food supply) and the supplementary feeding practice(s). These interactions are depicted qualitatively in Fig. 6. However in this diagrammatic representation, the possible changes in the dietary feeding habits of the cultured species are not accounted for; the feeding habits of some commonly cultured fish species often shifting with changes in the endogenous food supply (Odum, 1970; Werner and Hall, 1976; De Silva et al., 1984). For example, shifts in fish feeding habits are known to occur more readily under polyculture situations (Weatherly, 1963).

At this juncture, it is important to highlight the key role played by fish polyculture.

Fig. 7. Natural food resources utilized by the major fish species cultivated in Chinese polyculture ponds. Grass carp (A) and wuchang fish (B) feed upon land grasses and aquatic macrophytes; silver carp (C) graze upon phytoplankton; bighead carp (D) consume zooplankton; tilapias (E) feed upon both types of plankton, green fodders and benthic organic matter; black carp (F) eat molluscs; and common carp (G) and mud carp (H) consume benthic invertebrates and bottom detritus. (Zweig, 1985).

practices in SIFS. Fish polyculture strategies can be traced back to the Chinese Tang Dynasty (7th century A.D.; Zweig (1985)) and involve the mixed culture of two or more fish species with different and complementary feeding habits (ie. non-competitive) within the same pond environment. In contrast to single species farming or monoculture, mixed species farming or polyculture strategies facilitate the maximum utilization of the natural available food resources (ie. phytoplankton, zooplankton, bacterial laden detritus, macrophytes, benthic algae and animals) and water resources (ie. surface, pelagic and benthic) of the pond ecosystem with a consequent increase in pond productivity and fish yield per unit area (Fig. 7). As mentioned above, owing to the resource constraints of most small-scale farmers, emphasis has generally been placed on the development of polycultures involving the use of plankton/detritus filtering fish (ie. silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, bighead carp Aristichthys nobilis, catla Catla catla, rohu Labeo rohita, Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, blue tilapia Oreochromis aureus, Tambakan Helostoma temminicki) and other fish species feeding low on the aquatic food chain such as herbivorous fish species (ie. grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella, giant gourami Osphronemus goramy; tilapia, ie. Tilapia rendalli, T. shiranus, T. sparrmanii, T. zillii; silver barb Puntius gonionotus; and nilem Osteochilus hasseltii) and omnivorous/detritivorous benthic feeding fish species (ie. common carp Cyprinus carpio, grey mullet Mugil cephalus, mozambique tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus, milkfish Chanos chanos, mud carp Cirrhinus molitorella and mrigal Cirrhinus mrigala). In fact the top four most cultivated fish species in the world are usually produced together as a polyculture within SIFS in China, namely the silver carp (a phytoplankton filter feeder), common carp (a omnivorous/detritus bottom feeder), grass carp (a herbivorous macrophytic feeder) and bighead carp (a zooplankton filter feeder; Fig. 5).

information and examples of different fish polyculture combinations used in the tropics within SIFS see Stickney (1978), Zweig (1985), Lilystrom et al. (1987), Tacon (1988), Clonts et al. (1989), Fuhrmann (1991), Milstein et al. (1991), Nitithamyong et al. (1991), Kumar (1992), Edwards (1993), Nandeesha (1993), Pantha (1993) and Somsued (1993).

Generally, within SIFS as the difference between the standing crop (SC) of the culture organisms(s) and the critical standing crop of natural food (CSC-NF) increases, the deficit in natural protein supply increases. The changes in protein requirements of supplemental feed(s) in relation to the standing corp are depicted in Fig. 8. This increase in supplementary protein requirements in relation to SC is gradual as has been shown by Hepher et al. (1971) and Hepher (1975) in their experiments with common carp (C. carpio).

The utilization efficiency of a supplementary feed is also influenced by the natural food supply, in addition to those factors which affect the efficiency in all systems (ie. body weight and standing crop). For example a sub-optimal supplementary feed will be utilized with decreasing apparent efficiency as the natural food availability decreases, particularly at high levels of standing crop; the reverse being true at low fish standing crops with increasing natural food availability (Steffens, 1991; Tacon, 1993a). In the case of decreasing natural food availability, the farmer, according to Hepher (1988), is faced with one of three options: either 1) improve the diet by adding missing or limiting nutrients (this results in an increase in the cost which may not necessarily be paid off by corresponding increase in yield); 2) reduce the SC (this results in a decrease yield); or 3) increase productivity by fertilization or manuring.

The above consideration has been highlighted to stress the fact that supplementary feeding in SIFS is not straightforward and that it has many facets. In order to be economical, the farmer has to be alert in regard to the type and quantity of feed used, and equally so in regard to the natural endogenous food supply within the pond.


## 4. Supplementary feeds

Supplementary feeds include all feed items which can be directly consumed by cultured fish, ranging from exogenously supplied live invertebrate foods (i.e. termites, ants, *Artemia*, annelid worms etc.), living or freshly cut plants (i.e. terrestrial and aquatic macrophytes, leaves), kitchen waste, single processed feed ingredient (i.e. rice bran, cereal grains and by-product meals), on-farm produced feed mixtures (in mash, dough ball or pellet form) to factory manufactured pelleted compound aquafeeds (Fig. 9). From the above, it is clear that almost any edible food item may be considered as a potential supplementary feed. For example, Table 3 shows the reported feed conversion efficiencies of some commonly used supplementary feeds for warm-water fish species in China.

In most SIFS in the tropics the supplementary feeds used are simple food items (i.e. aquatic macrophyte, agricultural waste or by-product) or feed mixtures; their selection by farmers usually being dictated by availability and cost rather than by quality or nutritional value (Jantrarotai and Jantrarotai, 1993; Nuov and Nandeesha, 1993; Tacon, 1993). In view of the above selection method employed by farmers, it is perhaps not surprising that the number of feed ingredients used is very diverse, even within a single region; the diversity being further increased when the number of possible combinations of ingredient mixes are taken into consideration.

For example, Veerina (S. Veerina, personal communication, 1993) has recently documented the use of supplementary feeds by carp farmers employing SIFS in the Southeastern State of Andhra Pradesh (AP) in India, which has recently witnessed an almost explosive growth in the polyculture of Indian major carps. In general they found that the AP farmers used nine basic feed ingredients (Table 4), and that in all instances the final feed provided to the fish consisted of one of six different feed combinations; each combination consisting of a mix of two main feed ingredients, supplemented with

small quantities of one or more minor ingredients (Table 5). In a small number of cases a single ingredient, de-oiled rice bran, was used as the sole supplementary feed. In all instances the feeds were presented to the fish in powdery form by placing the feed mashes within perforated polyurethane sacks and suspending the bags over the water surface.

According to Veerina the AP farmers have each settled on their respective "feed mixture" or formulae after about 5-10 years of trial and error. The farmers are also convinced that the supplementary feed and feeding practice adopted by them give them the best returns. Furthermore, there is no documentary evidence to show that any of the

farmers have gone out-of-business; the farming activity is still increasing, both in the area that is converted into aquaculture production and the degree of intensity of individual practices.

It might be argued that the supplementary feeds used by AP farmers are acting principally as a fertilizer, enriching the natural food supply on which the target species feed. The farmers have been keeping track of the performance of their activities and they believe that the yields have been gradually increased with the adoption of these feeding practices, which in the earlier instances were even more primitive. The farmers records indicate the present yields are far in excess of what was achieved through fertilization alone. Therefore, indirect evidence on the farming practices indicates that the feeds used by AP farmers, which lack any animal protein source, are likely to be making an important contribution to the nutrition of the culture species.

In China, the culture of Chinese major carps in reservoir coves (ranging in size from 0.5 to 5 ha) is becoming an increasingly popular practice (Qinfang et al., 1992). In this form of aquaculture, as in the case of AP system, simple ‘‘feed mixes’’ are often used; the composition of the feed mixes varying from region to region and usually reflecting the availability of agricultural by-products. For example, in some regions rape seed meal will constitute the main ingredient, whereas in others soybean meal will be the main ingredient. According to Qinfang et al. (1992), the farmers carefully monitor the dissolved oxygen (DO) content of the water, and adjust their feeding rates accordingly.

The diversity of supplementary feeds within tropical SIFS is perhaps best exemplified when the shrimp culture practices in the coastal region of the State of Andhra Pradesh are considered. As evident from Table 6 (Wood et al., 1992), the ingredient mix is quite different. In this shrimp culture practice, the ingredients are cooked and made into paste balls. These paste balls are kept at pre-determined feeding sites (about 30 per hectare). It has been reported by Wood et al. (1992) that the trials conducted by them, on a nutritionally balanced shrimp feed, formulated based on the conventional wisdom of nutritionists, resulted in an inferior performance compared to that of the traditional existing practice. Obviously, there is a lot more happening in the nutrition of the target species in semi-intensive aquaculture, the science of which is little understood. Perhaps with the increasing emphasis on semi-intensive culture, particularly of shrimp (Hirasawa,

What is noteworthy is the diversity and simplicity of the feed practices that are utilized in semi-intensive culture in the tropics, irrespective of the target species. The results, in terms of production levels, are obtained using what is conceived to be sub-optimal feeds and feeding practices. As already mentioned, there are obviously innumerable gaps in our knowledge and understanding of the science of fish nutrition within SIFS.

### 5. Farm-made feeds: associated problems

The semi-intensive aquaculture industry of the tropics, though by and large dependent upon the use of on-farm prepared feeds, also faces problems with respect to ingredient availability. These are somewhat analogous to those problems associated with the use of fish-meal for carnivorous cultivated fish species (Wijkstrom and New, 1989). For example, oilseed meals commonly used as the main source of dietary protein for omnivorous cyprinid species (ie. common carp) also have alternative uses either for human consumption or livestock production. The demand for a specific number of agricultural by-products for semi-intensive aquaculture in a particular region or sub-region can be quite high and such demands are growing with the increase in area which is coming under aquaculture, as well as with the increasing dependence on supplemental feeds. Whilst the aquaculture sector may have been successful in the past in obtaining the necessary fertilizer and feed inputs, this may not be the case in the future as farming systems intensify and the demand for a finite pool of agricultural resources increases. Clearly, one of the potential advantages of SIFS for omnivorous/herbivorous fish species over IFS for carnivorous fish species is the lower dependence of SIFS upon fish-meal, and the possibility of totally eliminating the use of fish-meal and animal proteins within supplementary feeds for these species (Wee, 1991; Tacon, 1993b).

### 6. Feeding practices

As pointed out earlier, the feeding practices generally utilized within SIFS have been very simple. Rarely are automated feeding devices used and simple broadcasting is the primary method of feed dispensation for non-carnivores, except perhaps for systems with grass carp (Fig. 10(a)). However, in cyprinid polyculture it is common to use "feeding bags", which are suspended at a number of locations, the perforated bottoms, touching the water surface (Fig. 10(b)). Although there has been no scientific evaluation of the efficacy of this feeding method, most farmers believe the returns to be higher when this method is adopted as opposed to hand broadcasting. Some farmers even claim that they adjust the quantity of feed dispensed based on simple, turbidity determinations. Here again, hard data is lacking. In semi-intensive aquaculture there is a need for research in these directions; obviously it will be impossible to develop feeding charts similar to those recommended for intensive salmonid culture, but approximate guidelines

Results of field studies, in mono- and poly-culture systems of cyprinids by Nandee-sha (1993) have confirmed the additional possibility of applying the concept of mixed feeding schedules (De Silva, 1985) within SIFS. Adoption of appropriate mixed feeding schedules has been shown to result in yields similar to those obtained using a nutritionally optimal diet, but it results in feed cost savings of up to 30%. This practice also reduces the nitrogen input into the system by 20-25%. As pointed out by De Silva (1993), extension of a concept such as this is rather easier than that of a laboratory developed diet in a rural scenario. The adoption of mixed feeding schedules does not

### 7. Economic rationale in semi-intensive culture

In the very recent past, there has been increasing advocacy for a shift towards semi-intensive shrimp culture, particularly in the tropics (Hirasawa, 1992; Akiyama, 1993). Hirasawa (1992) put forward two models on the break-even chart per unit acreage and per unit weight of produce for extensive, semi-intensive and intensive shrimp culture (Fig. 12). Using these models and fitting data on a number of species of shrimp culture practices, he went on to demonstrate that increasing the intensity from extensive to intensive was the most economically rational alternative. However, he pointed out that the culture should be made intensive (or in real terms the upper scale of semi-intensive) not by increasing seed and feed input but by improving pond construction and the utmost utilization of natural productivity. Akiyama (1993), however, demonstrated that the use of sub-optimal quality feeds (sub-optimal here meaning feeds which were formulated and not adequate on their own to provide complete nutrition of the species) resulted in good, acceptable yields, comparable to those that are obtained with use of high-quality feeds. Indirectly, these trials demonstrate the usability of the "economically optimal protein level" concept developed for tilapia (De Silva et al., 1989).

It is evident therefore, that there is resurgence in the acceptance that, by and large, semi-intensive aquaculture is a more suitable form of culture in the tropics, and that optimal utilization of the indigenous food production is the most appropriate economic and biological approach. Obviously, there are a lot of unknowns for such systems, as well as a lot of existing farming practices which are yet to be given a sound scientific rationale. These lacunae in our knowledge, however, do not preclude these practices from being sound, although, perhaps, gaps in our understanding will delay further improvements of the returns from such systems as well as restricting their sustainability in the long term.
